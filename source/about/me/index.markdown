My name is Jacob Helwig, and I am a software developer particularly
interested in analytics, and system administration.  I have been doing
professional software development since late 2007, and system
administration since mid-2002.

I am also a strong supporter of Open Source projects, contributing to
a number of projects, as well as maintaining a few [CPAN modules][cpan]
and [Ruby Gems][] of my own.

I am a founding member of, and continue to organize,
[the first of the many weekly hackathons][PDX Weekly Hackathon] here
in Portland, OR.  In addition to the weekly hackathon, these are a few
of the things I help organize:

* [Open Source Bridge][]
  * 2010 & 2011 content selection committee.
* [Ignite Portland][]
  * IP10 tech coordination.

I am a habitual learner, and am always seeking better (more
efficient & elegent) ways to do whatever it is that I am working on
at the time.  I have also earned a reputation of having very high
standards for code review, and have repeadedly been told by
colleagues that they look forward to the code reviews since they
have always been very constructive.

I can most easily be reached via [email][] and [Twitter][].

I can be found online at a number of places (there may be a pattern here):

* GitHub - [jhelwig][github]
* Twitter - [@jhelwig][twitter]
* coderwall - [jhelwig][coderwall]
* RubyGems.org - [jhelwig][rubygems.org]
* CPAN - [jhelwig][cpan]
* GitHub meets CPAN - [jhelwig][GitHub meets CPAN]
