[Ben Hengst][notbenh] recently acquired a pretty nice find from the
Salvation Army, with one slight problem.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacob_helwig/7510805892/" title="JVC TK-1070U by jacob.helwig, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7510805892_8295ff7563_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="JVC TK-1070U"></a>

This item seems to be near non-existant on the internet, when it comes
to useful information (such as pinouts, and what's necessary to
actually capture at 1000 FPS).

We haven't gotten it powered up yet, but that should happen fairly
soon (bench supply should arrive tomorrow; been meaning to get one for
a while), since that was one of the few pinouts that was available on
the internet.

If you have information on the JVC TK-1070U (or could put us in touch
with someone that does) we'd love to speak with you.
