[Ben Hengst][notbenh] recently acquired a pretty nice find from the
<del>Salvation Army</del> <ins>Goodwill</ins>, with one slight problem.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacob_helwig/7510805892/" title="JVC TK-1070U by jacob.helwig, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7510805892_8295ff7563_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="JVC TK-1070U"></a>

This item seems to be near non-existant on the internet, when it comes
to useful information (such as pinouts, and what's necessary to
actually capture at 1000 FPS).

We haven't gotten it powered up yet, but that should happen fairly
soon (bench supply should arrive tomorrow; been meaning to get one for
a while), since that was one of the few pinouts that was available on
the internet.

If you have information on the JVC TK-1070U (or could put us in touch
with someone that does) we'd love to speak with you.

Plus a few more details (and a correction) from Ben:

1. It's from Goodwill rather then Salvation Army, note the sticker.
2. [Pinout for power][power-pinout] from an [ebay auction][power-ebay-auction]
3. [Marketing specs for camera][marketing-specs]
4. Seems that it "speaks" targa thus seems that there is some special
boards that are required to do the processing, though none have been
made for a while. Is this something that we can dump the raw data to
disk and rebuild after the fact or is there some "secret sauce" on the
board that make this useless unless properly mated to the right
hardware?
