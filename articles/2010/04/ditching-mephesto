A while back, I'd ditched [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress blog engine")
in favor of [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/ "Mephisto blog engine").
I'd grown tired of constantly being under attack from spammers, and
really disliked that it was one gigantic PHP app.

Once I was on Mephisto, I really liked the syntax highlighting I got
with the [Ultraviolet Gem](http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/ "Ultraviolet gem"),
but it requires
[Oniguruma](http://oniguruma.rubyforge.org/ "Oniguruma gem"), which was
a pain to setup on my shared host (they have since added it to their
hosts).  Life was good.

Except that it wasn't.  It was a little annoying how long it took pages
to come up in the "cold cache" case, and I'd actually gotten a few
complaints about that.  After this, I decided that I was just going to
do away with "dynamic blog engines" entirely.

Enter [WWW::StaticBlog](http://github.com/jhelwig/WWW-StaticBlog "WWW::StaticBlog 'engine'").
I decided that I was just going to
statically generate every page, and upload them to the shared host.  No
more worrying about spammers trying to "hack" my site, and no more slow
page loads waiting for a full Ruby on Rails app to start up.

So far the features of WWW::StaticBlog are:

* Pluggable templating system.  (Currently only has a plugin for
  [Template::Toolkit](http://template-toolkit.org/ "Perl's Template::Toolkit"))
* Support for tagging articles, and browsing articles by arbitrary
  combinations of tags.
* Atom feed for posts.
* Support for purely static content.

Things I plan on adding:

* Author pages, with the ability to browse posts by author.
* Support for more templating engines
  ([Template::Mustache](http://github.com/pvande/Template-Mustache "Mustache for Perl")
  will probably be the next one.)
* Archives pages to view past posts by year/month.
* Only generate the pages that have actually changed, instead of
  regenerating everything, every time.

The idea behind
[WWW::StaticBlog](http://github.com/jhelwig/WWW-StaticBlog "WWW::StaticBlog 'engine'")
is that the host does not need to have
support for _anything_, other than serving up static files, and you'll
still have what would look like a dynamically generated site.

As a live example of how to use
[WWW::StaticBlog](http://github.com/jhelwig/WWW-StaticBlog "WWW::StaticBlog 'engine'"),
you can check out the
[Git repository for this site](http://github.com/jhelwig/technosorcery.net "Git repository for technosorcery.net").
